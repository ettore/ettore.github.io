<h2>Stuff I built / helped building</h2>
<dl>
	<dt class="drama">PIX System iOS app</dt>
	<dd>I'm building apps used by Hollywood directors, actors and executives, many of which are popular household names that created many films I love. To deliver a solid professional product, I focused on establishing processes for the team to move fast in the long term while still keeping code quality high: efficient workflows for git work and app releases; investment in CI/CD, unit testing, refactoring, code readability and documentation; thorough code reviews. Since we have multiple apps, I split the code base of the main app into reusable Swift/ObjC frameworks. Mentoring played a much bigger role than in previous positions, and it has been very rewarding to see younger engineers grow.<br/>[<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pix-system/id438296952">App Store page</a>]</dd>

  <dt class="drama">Goodreads iOS app</dt>
	<dd>I was the 1st iOS hire and took over the app that was built by contractors. I helped develop new navigation (twice!), new book page, barcode scanner, on-device caching, Facebook onboarding, localization and more. I directed my attention to critical issues such as memory and performance, helping the strong growth the company was experiencing on mobile platforms, leading to the acquisition by Amazon in 2013. When I left in 2015 the app was 99% built natively in Objective-C. I'm particularly proud of this work because (1) I got to work for a company that was helping readers, (2) I was able to do some open source contributions, and (3) I worked with an exceptional team and I learned a ton of stuff there.<br/>[<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreads/id355833469?mt=8">App Store page</a>]</dd>

  <dt class="drama">Open Source Contributions</dt>
	<dd>I have to say, the most rewarding experience I've ever had while developing software was to contribute to open source / free software projects. Here's a few projects I collaborated to:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Blender</strong> (3D content creation suite): I added support (C/C++) for 3Dconnexion / Logitech's N degrees of freedom devices. This shipped in <a href="https://archive.blender.org/wiki/index.php/Template:Release_Notes/2.46/Contributors/">v2.46</a> with some bugfixes in <a href="https://archive.blender.org/wiki/index.php/Dev:Ref/Release_Notes/2.47/">2.47</a>. Here's some community posts <a href="https://www.3dconnexion.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1497">(1)</a> <a href="https://www.blender.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12230">(2)</a> and some patches <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/bf-blender-cvs@blender.org/msg01179.html">(1)</a> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/bf-blender-cvs@blender.org/msg01025.html">(2)</a>.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Second Life</strong> (MMORPG): Same deal, I added support (C++) for 3Dconnexion / Logitech's 3D devices to control your avatar in 6 degrees of freedom. This shipped in <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Release_Notes/Second_Life_Release/1.20#Release_Notes_for_Second_Life_1.20.15_Jul_24th.2C_2008">v1.20</a>.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Three20</strong> (new defunct iOS library): several bug fixes (Objective-C), see <a href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/three20/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aettore">my pull requests</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    I'd love to do more of this in the future!
  </dd>

  <dt class="drama">ChessNote (old side project)</dt>
	<dd>A correspondence chess game for the iPhone. Built with Objective-C, Erlang, OpenBSD. This is the first iOS app I ever worked on, cutting my teeth on i<em>Phone</em>OS 3 and supporting it till iOS 9. It was also an opportunity to learn a functional programming language (very fascinating topic) and server maintentance / configuration. <!--br/>[<a href="/chessnote">ChessNote</a> | <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chessnote/id408601586?mt=8">App Store page</a>]--></dd>

  <dt class="drama">Other</dt>
	<dd>My <a href="https://github.com/ettore">GitHub</a> hosts some other old and no longer maintained stuff. Feel free to peruse, but keep in mind that when I look at it today that is <em>not</em> something I'm particularly proud of any more!</dd>

<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>Music is my biggest passion: I enjoy playing drums and keyboards and listening to all sorts of music -- from metal and punk rock to Motown and classical music. I also <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/ettore">enjoy reading</a> immensely, and that's the main reason why I joined Goodreads back then. Nature and the outdoors are a recent interest that I intend to explore more in the near future.</p>
